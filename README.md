# SgCabMapProject01
Inspired by a few online visualizations such as:

[Sumbera's Data Blog](https://blog.sumbera.com/2014/06/08/leaflet-webgl-many-points-rendering/)
[Ben Young Quan's Live Taxi Map](https://yongquanben.github.io/sg_taxi_availability/)

this project is initiated to practice front-end/d3 coding on a map project 
as well as explore the analytics involved in geo data.
